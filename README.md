Core is a completely modular system that would be deployed over a large Minecraft network.

Core is responsible for many things. Of it's modules, the main being "Core" itself, it divides up tasks like

- Storing information against users

- Managing user groups (by providing it's own group system) and permissions

- Dealing with channeled chat

- Sending information across servers (abstracted well so you can send many many kinds of messages)

- Storing maps across networks

As well as other complex functionality that would need to be used for a large network.
